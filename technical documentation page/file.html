  <section class="main-section" id="Espresso_(Short_Black)"><header><code>Espresso (Short Black)</code></header><p>The espresso (aka “short black”) is the foundation and the most important part to every espresso based drink. So much so that we’ve written a guide on how to make the perfect espresso shot. But for the purposes of this post an espresso consists of:
<li>1 Shot of espresso in an espresso cup</p></section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Long_Black_(Americano)"><header><code>Long Black (Americano)</code></header><p>A long black (aka “americano”) is hot water with an espresso shot extracted on top of the hot water. It is made as follows:

<li>Fill a cup with 2/3rds full of hot water <li>Extract 1 shot of espresso over the hot water

<div id="barista">Barista Tip: Make sure you back-wash your portafilter before making a long black, otherwise you might find grinds from your coffee grinder floating in your coffee.</div></p></section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Café_Latte"><header><code>Café Latte</code></header><p>A café latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to an espresso due to the steamed milk. It is made as follows:

<li>Extract 1 shot of espresso into a tumbler glass<li>Add steamed milk<li>1cm of micro-foam on top of the steamed milk

  <div id="barista">Barista tip: In the USA it is common to use a cup instead of a tumbler glass for a latte.</div></p></section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Cappuccino"><header><code>Cappuccino</code></header><p>A cappuccino is similar to a latte. However the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further a cappuccino is made in a cup rather than a tumbler glass. It is made as follows:

<li>Extract 1 shot of espresso into a cup<li>Add steamed milk<li>Add 2-3cm of micro-foam on top of the steamed milk<li>Sprinkle chocolate on top of the coffee</p></section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Flat_White"><header><code>Flat White</code></header><p>A flat white is a coffee you’ll primarily find in Australia and New Zealand. It is made the same as a cappuccino expect it does not have any foam or chocolate on top. It is made like this:

<li>1 shot of espresso into a cup<li>Add steamed milk into the cup but no micro-foam</p></section>
